# Caveats

Tide is on the alpha release, use with caution. APIs are likely to change before the stable version, that there will be breaking changes and that we're not supporting it for external production sites at the moment.

# INTRODUCTION
The Tide distribution has been developed as a part of the Single Digital Presence project from the Department of Premier and Cabinet in Victoria. For further information visit the Single Digital Presence website, https://sdp.vic.gov.au, The github project page, https://github.com/dpc-sdp/tide or the Drupal project page, https://drupal.org/project/tide. Tide utilises a number of SDP specific modules with the `tide_` prefix, providing a range of functionality designed speficically for the State Government of Victoria Australia.

The Tide profile is built as a backend Drupal distribution for 1 or more headless websites and is specifically built for the Ripple frontend framework, written in Vue.JS, https://github.com/dpc-sdp/ripple. The majority of the functionality for this purpose is within the tide_api, https://github.com/dpc-sdp/tide_api, module.

A main feature of the SDP project is central content management of numerous alternate websites, providing the ability to build complex user journeys across multiple websites within a single CMS; this is provided mainly by the tide_site, https://github.com/dpc-sdp/tide_site, module.
